Welcome to pyvsim!
==================

pyvsim, Python Visualization Simulation is a tool for helping in the set-up 
of optical measurement systems.

It includes camera models and the possibility of importing CAD models for the 
calculation of parameters such as field and depth of view.

The physical simulation is written in a generic form, so the project can be 
adapted for many uses (maybe even 3d scenarios rendering).

For the moment, pyvsim is more concentrated in simulating PIV equipment, a nice
example of what it can already do is the configuration below.

.. figure:: ./pivdemo.png
	:scale: 50%
    :align: center
	
	A one-camera PIV configuration using a mirror
	
It can also be used to generate synthetic images of particles (but it's not so 
efficient doing so).

.. figure:: ./synth.png
	:scale: 50%
	:align: center
	
	An example synthetic image

This site is generated from the pyvsim source code, and it is an ongoing 
project.

Getting started with pyvsim
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to do this tutorial, download pyvsim at our
`Google Code page <http://code.google.com/p/pyvsim/>`_, unpack it (or
clone the source).

The interface
=============

There are two possible ways of talking to pyvsim. The first is using plain
python code, as pyvsim behaves just like a module. This allows access to all
the functionalities of the code, and is also very practical, as it also allows
the integration with other scripts. Pyvsim can also be used in the python console.

The second way of interfacing with pyvsim is through environment and instruction
files. This method will be preferred in the example here. Most functions can be
accessed with this method, but with that, you lose the power of python.

Introduction
============

When creating a simulation with pyvsim, one has to keep in mind
that the simulation elements must be contained in a tree. This is
essential for performing the simulation, allowing each element to
be aware of each other.

Below there is an example of a simulation tree. The user is free to create
the tree in any possible way. The only limitation is that *all the simulation
elements must be contained in a single tree*. This means that we have to add
everything to the same environment, the depth, however, doesn't matter.

Creating an environment
=======================

Environments can be specified with the aid of a `JSON <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`_ 
file. The format is very simple and human-readable, and the creation of an environment is
done simply by::

	{
	"name" : "myEnvironmentName"
	}
	
In order to create a valid pyvsim environment, all elements must be included between
these curly braces, and that is all!

Populating the environment
==========================

Now we have to populate the environment with simulation elements,
for example, one can add a camera::

	{
	"name"      : "myEnvironmentName",
	"camera1"   : {"type"        : "Camera"}
	}
	
All elements in pyvsim are initialized with their reference
point at the point :math:`(0,0,0)` pointing at the same direction as the 
:math:`x` axis. There are a series of operations if one wants to change that.

Importing CAD geometries
------------------------

Pyvsim is also capable of importing geometries from CAD models. In order
to do so, these geometries must be expressed as STL files.

The syntax of importing geometries is the following::

	{
	"name"        : "myEnvironmentName",
	"mySTLFile"   : {"type"             : "STL",
                     "filename"         : "./mystlfile.stl"}
	}

Positioning components
======================

Checking the documentation of the :doc:`Component` class, the 
following methods can be used for changing the camera position:

	* rotate
	* translate
	* alignTo
	
Let's translate the camera we have created. Checking the documentation page,
one can see that we need a vector with :math:`\left ( \Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z \right )`,
and that the parameter name is "vector". So we can simply write::

	{
	"name"      : "myEnvironmentName",
	"camera1"   : {"type"        : "Camera",
				   "translate"   : {"vector" : [1, 0, 0]}}
	}
	
The name of the parameters and the behavior of the functions can be consulted
in the :doc:`Component` documentation.

** Assemblies are also components! **, it means that you can move an 
entire assembly at once::

	{
	"name"        : "myEnvironmentName",
	"camera1"     : {"type"        : "Camera"},
	"translate"   : {"vector" : [1, 0, 0]}
	}
